# Part 3

1. The bug entails weak typing; both `num1` and `num2` are added together, but they are typed as strings, so the operation used on them is string concatenation rather than addition.
2. I fixed the bug by ensuring that `num1` and `num2` are typed as integers, using the `parseInt` function to convert strings to integers. Fix is included in the file `debugger-fix-parseInt-proof.png`.
